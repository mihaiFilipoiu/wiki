# 📚 Wiki Encyclopedia App (academic project)

Welcome to our Wiki Encyclopedia app! 🎉 Here's what our app can do:

## Entry Page 📝

Visiting `/wiki/TITLE` will display the contents of the specified encyclopedia entry. If the requested entry doesn't exist, we'll show you an error page.

## Index Page 📑

Browse through all our encyclopedia entries right from the index page. Simply click on any entry name to dive straight into it!

## Search 🔍

Looking for something specific? Use our search feature! Just type your query into the search box, and we'll find matching entries for you. If your query doesn't match any entries exactly, we'll show you a list of entries containing your query as a substring.

## New Page ✏️

Feeling inspired? Create a new encyclopedia entry with just a few clicks! Enter a title and the content in Markdown format, and we'll save it for you. If the title already exists, we'll let you know to avoid any duplicates.

## Edit Page 🖊️

Want to make some changes to an existing entry? No problem! Click the edit link on any entry page, and you can modify the Markdown content right there. Save your changes, and you're good to go!

## Random Page 🎲

Feeling adventurous? Take a chance and explore a random encyclopedia entry! Who knows what fascinating knowledge you'll stumble upon?

## Markdown to HTML Conversion 🌟

We've got your back when it comes to readability! Every entry's Markdown content is converted to HTML for a seamless reading experience.

🚀 Happy exploring! 🚀
